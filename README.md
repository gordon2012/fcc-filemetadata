### A freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Project

<https://file-metadata.gordondoskas.com>

A freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices project built with express and react. It employs an API endpoint that allows file metadata to be obtained from an uploaded file, such as file name and size in bytes. A simple front-end application with a form consumes the API.
